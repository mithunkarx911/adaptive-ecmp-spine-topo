# adaptive-ecmp-spine-topo
A Mininet-based SDN project implementing Adaptive ECMP routing on a Spine-Leaf data center topology using the Ryu controller. The system dynamically balances traffic across multiple equal-cost paths based on real-time network conditions like link utilization and latency.


# üß† Adaptive ECMP on Spine-Leaf Topology (SDN Project)

This project demonstrates **adaptive Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)** routing on a **spine-leaf topology** using **Mininet** and the **Ryu SDN controller**. Traditional ECMP routing is static and does not consider link utilization or traffic congestion. This project enhances ECMP by making it **adaptive to real-time network conditions**, improving **load balancing** and **network performance**.

## üéØ Objective

To design and implement an **adaptive ECMP algorithm** that:
- Simulates spine-leaf topology using Mininet
- Implements static ECMP and compares it with adaptive ECMP
- Uses SDN (Ryu controller) to dynamically update flow rules based on link metrics
